### Credits

CanvasLab owes a lot of credit to Alastair Tse and his [plotKit library](http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/).
A lot of the algorithms found in CanvasLab were derived from the work Alastair did on plotKit.

CanvasLab also uses a few derivatives of other open source tools.  Thanks to these fine chaps for making 
them.
