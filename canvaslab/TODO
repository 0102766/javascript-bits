* Allow single value datasets.  
  This should be a matter of checking if an array is 
  given and if not generate the first point.
* Theme doesn't use enough colors if there are numerous data sets
* Rip out some of the unwanted bloat from ToolKit.Color
* Unit Tests
* Code Optimization (Speed, Speed, Speed)
* [C] Horizontal Bar
* Stacked Bar
* Re-implement DOM Builder using Base  
* Implement Legends (Export datasets to html list?)
* Remove ToolKit Namespace?
* Image's as Backgrounds (Tile/Static)


RESEARCH/MAYBE
